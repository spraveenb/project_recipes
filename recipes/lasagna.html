    Easy Lasagna Recipe

    I suppose since I have recipes for Skillet Lasagna, Lasagna Soup, Lasagna Roll Ups, and Taco Lasagna, we are long
    overdue for me to share my easy, classic lasagna recipe.

    This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of
    mozzarella cheese.

    This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.
